# Real-Time Mars visual sources

- `mars-viking-jpl.jpg` — global simple-cylindrical Viking image mosaic,
  1440×720, from the NASA/JPL Solar System Simulator texture archive.
  Source: https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/tmaps/mars.html
- `mola-topography.png` — browser-ready height texture derived without
  resampling from `MEGT90N000CB.IMG`, the 4-pixels/degree Mars Global
  Surveyor MOLA Mission Experiment Gridded Data Record. The source grid is
  signed 16-bit big-endian topography in metres, with a published range of
  -8068 m to +21134 m. Its 0–360°E longitude axis is rolled into -180–180°
  to align with the color texture and Parker's Physics globe coordinates.

The page credits the original NASA/JPL/USGS and NASA/GSFC MOLA sources in
the visible interface. `scripts/build-mars-mola-texture.mjs` documents and
reproduces the binary-grid-to-PNG conversion.

## These two files are the FALLBACK, not the map

Both rasters are 1440×720 — 4 pixels/degree, ≈14.8 km/px at the equator. That
is the resolution mars.html rendered *everything* at before the tile stack, and
it is why the 520 km surface patch (~37 texels across) came out as a smooth
wash with the WFC synth layer covering the gap.

The map proper is now streamed from NASA's Solar System Treks through
`/api/mars/tiles` — see the "Surface imagery tiles" section of
`data/mars/SOURCES.md`. These files are what the page falls back to when that
service is unreachable, and the layer row says so by name and by number when it
does. **Keep them.** They are also the offline-boot texture and the static
globe in `.mars-render-fallback`.

### Verified Trek layer identifiers

The candidate lists in `js/mars-tiles.js` were written with egress to
trek.nasa.gov blocked, so none of the identifiers below is confirmed. Record
them here as production settles them, then trim the candidate lists to match:

| Logical layer | Verified identifier | Verified on |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| `imagery` | `Mars_Viking_MDIM21_ClrMosaic_global_232m` (candidate 0) | 2026-09-26, production `/api/mars/tiles?meta=1` |
| `thermal` | _none — all three candidates 404 on trek.nasa.gov_ | 2026-09-26 |
| `highres` | _none — all three candidates 404 on trek.nasa.gov_ | 2026-09-26 |
| `topo` | `Mars_MGS_MOLA_ClrShade_merge_global_463m` (candidate 0) | 2026-09-26 |

The production probe answered `resolved_count: 2` with `freshness: 'stale'`
(thermal + highres unreachable). Imagery and topo are settled. THEMIS and CTX
need new candidate identifiers found on a networked machine before those layers
can stream; until then the page correctly falls back to the Viking mosaic for
them and says so.
