## 1. What TIGA is, said precisely

TIGA (Temporally Integrated Geomagnetic Assimilation) is a **sequential Bayesian
state estimator**: a Kalman filter whose state is the degree-1 *external* Gauss
coefficients (q₁⁰, q₁¹, s₁¹) plus their rates, updated each minute from
whichever observatories reported.

It is **not a simulation.** Nothing is integrated forward physically; the
"model" is an integrated random walk, which is a statistical prior, not
dynamics.

It is **not a forecast.** Zero lead time. It does not compete with L1-driven
forecast models on their axis — it is what you have when L1 is unavailable.

**And neither is Dst.** Retain only the zonal term of the degree-1 expansion and
the cosine-weighted station average *is* the least-squares estimator of q₁⁰ —
an algebraic identity, exact to 10⁻¹⁴, checked for every station subset in
`tests/geomag-tiga.mjs`. So the distinction is not estimator-versus-index.
Everything here is an estimator; they differ in how many parameters they fit,
how they weight stations, and whether they carry a prior. **Dst is the
one-parameter, equal-weight, no-memory degenerate case.**

That identity is load-bearing three ways, and each one is a product argument:

| Because… | …therefore |
|---|---|
| the observation operator H is rebuilt every epoch from whoever is present | dropout tolerance is **architectural, not trained** — which is why the curve stays flat from 64 stations down to 3, with the knee at the fitted-parameter count |
| a Bayesian estimator emits a posterior | there is **an uncertainty to sell**. Neither Kyoto nor USGS publishes one. It is also currently miscalibrated, which makes it the headline open problem rather than a footnote |
| the estimand is a physical coefficient rather than the index | estimation error (4.97 nT) can be **separated from the index's own definition error** (11.36 nT). Estimate "SYM-H" directly and the two are inseparable |

### 1.1 The trap: two quantities are in play

TIGA estimates **q₁⁰**. It is scored against **SYM-H** — a specific six-station
arithmetic recipe that differs from q₁⁰ by ~11 nT of aliasing. Every results
table therefore carries **two RMSEs**, and **calibration must be judged against
q₁⁰**. Score a coefficient estimator against an index and you are measuring the
index. Conflating these two is the single easiest way to produce a
confident-looking wrong number here.

## 2. Architecture

```
js/geomag/
  igrf14-coefficients.js   IGRF-14 table, 195 coefficients × 27 epochs. DATA.
  coastlines.js            schematic outlines for the field map. DATA.
  observatories.js         Kyoto Table 1 roster + USGS IAGA codes. DATA + provenance.
  igrf.js                  ← SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for field evaluation
  dipole.js                centred-dipole coords, SM frame, dipole tilt
  tiga.js                  the estimator + the classical index as its degenerate case
  core-model.js            layers, dimensionless numbers, free decay, mantle screening
  dynamo.js                Rikitake + αΩ parity selection
  osse.js                  observing-system experiment (offline, deterministic)
  ingest.js                live USGS → epochs → nowcast
  diffusion.js             ∂B/∂t = η∇²B on the core — SOLVED, validated to 0.03%
  field-lines.js           RK4 tracing + downward continuation to the CMB
  core-3d.js               three.js scene + three custom shaders (renderer only)
api/geomag/observatories.js  USGS edge proxy
tiga.html                    the three-layer page
```

**Hard rule:** `igrf.js` is the only place field evaluation happens. Three
separate bugs in the research programme this was ported from came from
re-deriving something that already existed and getting a sign or a stride wrong.
Every other module imports it.

**Layering by timescale is the product idea**, and each layer carries an honest
label on the page:

| Layer | Timescale | What it is | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core | 10³–10⁵ yr | reduced dynamo models (Rikitake, αΩ mean-field) | *model* |
| Field | 1–10² yr | IGRF-14 evaluated live, degree 13 | *observation-derived* |
| External | minutes | TIGA nowcast from live observatories | *real-time estimate* |

Only the third is real-time. **Do not let copy call any of this a geodynamo
simulation.** A real 3-D MHD dynamo needs a supercomputer and the best published
runs still sit eight orders of magnitude from Earth's Ekman number — a number
the page prints.

### 3.0 The 3D core view — what "high fidelity" means here

The Core layer renders three things, in descending order of how well-founded
they are, and none of them is a dynamo:

1. **The observed field, downward-continued to the core–mantle boundary.**
   Exact within IGRF-14 and a standard scientific product. The reversed-flux
   patches are real published features. The continuation gain is surfaced in
   the UI (6× at degree 1, **8,700× at degree 13**) because this is precisely
   where over-interpretation starts — continuation amplifies the coefficients'
   own error along with the signal, and past degree 13 it would amplify the
   *crustal* field as though it came from the core.
2. **Field lines traced by RK4 through that same field.** Exact integration of
   an exact field, so the shapes are computed rather than drawn. Reverse-tracing
   returns to the start to **0 km**. The L-shell split is emergent: a 30° seed
   band closes entirely inside the core, a 68° band escapes.
3. **Magnetic diffusion, ∂B/∂t = η∇²B, actually solved.** Spectral in angle
   (the angular structure separates exactly, so a 3-D problem is exactly one
   1-D radial solve per degree), implicit in radius. Validated against the
   analytic eigenvalues τ_n = μ₀σa²/k_n² to **0.026%** at every degree, and an
   arbitrary initial profile is shown to relax onto the fundamental
   (3,630 → 23,831 yr against an analytic 23,884).

**What is missing is the u×B term**, and that is the whole dynamo. Keeping it
means resolving a turbulent rotating flow at Ekman 10⁻¹⁵ and magnetic Prandtl
10⁻⁶ — numbers this page prints — which is a supercomputer problem. What the
diffusion solve buys instead is the other half of the physics done exactly:
*switch the dynamo off and watch what survives*. After 12 kyr the dipole is at
61% and degree 13 at 0.04%. **The dipole is what is left**, demonstrated rather
than asserted.

The three shaders each earn their place: the CMB fragment shader derives the
reversed-flux contour from the sampled field so it sits on the zero crossing at
any zoom; the mantle shader renders skin-depth attenuation as literal depth;
the field-line shader uses tubes rather than lines because a 1px line carries
no depth cue, which is the only reason to be in 3D at all. Radii are TRUE —
Earth 1.0, CMB 0.546, inner core 0.192, nothing compressed.

### 3.0.1 Layer structure and the tangent cylinder

The Core layer's interior view answers a question the shells make visible:
**only one of the five layers can host a dynamo, and it is not the most
conductive one.**

| Layer | σ (S/m) | flow U | R_m | τ diffusion | dynamo? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inner core | 10⁶ | — | **0** | 6,020 yr | no |
| Outer core | 10⁶ | 0.4 mm/s | **1,135** | 20,580 yr | **YES** |
| Lower mantle | 3 | — | 0 | 1.9×10⁶ s | no |
| Upper mantle | 10⁻² | — | 0 | 5×10² s | no |
| Crust | 10⁻³ | — | 0 | 0.16 s | no · magnetisable |

The inner core is **exactly as conductive as the outer core** and still cannot
host a dynamo, because R_m = UL/η is a *product* and a solid layer contributes
U = 0 however conductive it is. Conductivity is necessary; motion is what is
scarce. The inner core is not idle either — field can only *diffuse* through
it, on a 6,020-year timescale, which is the basis of the published idea that it
stabilises reversals.

**The tangent cylinder** — tangent to the inner core, aligned with the spin
axis — is where the Taylor–Proudman constraint splits the fluid in two. At
Rossby ≈ 10⁻⁶ Coriolis overwhelms inertia, flow becomes invariant along the
rotation axis, and a column that would have to pass through the solid inner
core cannot exist. Outside it: columnar rolls, helical with opposite handedness
per hemisphere — which *is* the antisymmetric α-effect that `dynamo.js` shows
can prefer a dipole. Inside it: the polar regions, largely decoupled. It meets
the CMB at **69.45°** latitude (sin θ = r_IC/r_CMB), so the boundary projects to
high latitude at the top of the core, not to the pole.

So "rotation selects the dipole" is not a slogan — it is this geometry.

The view carries a **mode-aware key**, because a static one listing everything
the scene *can* draw is wrong in every mode — most of it is not on screen. Its
swatches read the palettes exported from `core-3d.js`, the same constants the
materials use, so the two cannot drift apart; `tests/tiga-smoke.spec.js`
compares every rendered swatch against the exported value. In Layer structure
the key carries each shell's conductivity and its dynamo verdict, which puts
the §3.0.1 punchline on screen rather than 800px below it.

The cutaway plane is re-derived from the camera every frame, so opening it
always opens *toward the viewer*. A world-fixed plane is the obvious
implementation and the wrong one: orbit 180° and the opening is behind the
body. The azimuth it uses is the camera's bearing **from the pivot**, not its
world bearing — those stopped agreeing the moment panning was enabled, and the
two expressions are identical while the pivot sits at the centre.

### 3.0.2 The camera — the page may start a flight, it may not hold the camera

Camera range spans 0.14–30 R_E, from inside the inner core out to roughly the
sunward magnetopause. Getting a 214× range to feel like one instrument took
four decisions, and the first of them is a bug fix.

**The framing flight is one-shot and interruptible.** It used to be a standing
spring: `render()` eased `camera.position` toward the active layer's framing
distance *every frame, forever*. OrbitControls reads the camera position back
at the top of its own `update()`, so the spring was not a flight — it silently
reverted the user's own zoom about a second after every scroll, and it scaled
the camera's **world** position, which is only "dolly" while the pivot is at
the origin. With `zoomToCursor` moving the pivot off the origin on every
scroll, it slewed the camera sideways as well. The flight is now a tween that
any drag, scroll, pinch, key or button cancels, working in the pivot's frame.
It eases on an e-folding **time**, not a per-frame fraction, so the same
flight lasts ~1.2 s at 60 fps and ~1.2 s on a software rasteriser; the
per-frame version took eight seconds on the CI runner and read as a hang.

**`zoomToCursor` is off; panning is on and bounded.** Zoom-to-cursor sounds
friendlier and on a body-centred scene it is not: three.js r160 re-places
`controls.target` in front of the camera on every cursor zoom, so a few
scrolls near the limb walk the orbit pivot off the planet and dragging then
orbits a point in empty space. Moving the pivot is now explicit — double-click
to focus, **Recentre** to put it back — and panning (right-drag, two fingers,
the pan bound `maxTargetRadius = 2.6 R_E`) is what lets you put something
other than the centre of the Earth in the middle of the frame.

**Near and far ride the distance.** A fixed 0.05 near plane against a 0.14
minimum distance clips a third of the way to the pivot, so zooming into the
inner core sliced its front off at exactly the moment someone got interested;
a fixed far of 100 against a 2.2 R_E scene spends depth precision on nothing.
Both now track the camera, with hysteresis so they are not rewritten every
frame. Rotate speed tracks it too — a fixed angular rate that feels controlled
at 3 R_E whips the horizon past at 0.2.

**The pointer probe reads the kernel, not the picture.** Hovering reports
latitude, longitude, depth, B_r and |B| at the picked point, evaluated with
`igrf.js fieldGeocentric` on the *same* coefficients the shells are textured
from — never by sampling the shader's own colormap back, which would report
the palette. Picking is analytic (every pickable is a sphere about the origin,
so the intersection is a quadratic) rather than a raycast against ~20k
triangles per shell per pointer move, and observatory markers on the far limb
are not pickable, because a marker you cannot see is not one you can click.
**Below the core–mantle boundary the probe reports no field value at all**:
IGRF is a potential field, the region below the CMB contains its own source
currents, and continuing the model into them is not a measurement. The readout
says that instead of printing an authoritative-looking number, and hands over
the layer's conductivity and dynamo verdict in its place.

The whole cluster is keyboard-reachable — the canvas is focusable, arrows
orbit, `+`/`−` zoom, `R` resets. A data surface only a mouse can explore is a
WCAG 2.1.1 failure, and this one carries readings.

### 3.1 Numerical gates, all passing

| Gate | Threshold | Current |
|---|---|---|
| Pure dipole on a sphere, max/min | 2.000 ± 1e-4 | **2.000000** |
| Pure dipole on WGS-84 | = 2(a/b)³ | **2.020253** (flattening, not a bug) |
| SAA minimum, 2025 | 22,071 ± 5 nT | **22,071.4** |
| Dipole free-decay time, n = 1 | 23,884 ± 50 yr | **23,884** |
| Magnetic Reynolds number | 1135 ± 5 | **1135** |
| First zeros of jₙ vs SciPy | < 5e-4 | passes n = 1…20 |
| T3 identity: cos-average ≡ −q₁⁰ | < 1e-10 nT | **2.8e-14** |
| `designRow` ≡ paper Eq. (1) | < 1e-12 | **1.1e-16** |
| αΩ growth rates vs SciPy (N=400) | < 0.3% | passes at D = −200, −600, −1500 |
| Index definition floor | 11.36 nT | **11.36** (exact — it is deterministic) |
| Grid evaluator vs scalar path | identical | **0.0** |
| Diffusion solver vs analytic τ_n | < 0.5% | **0.026%** at every degree |
| Field-line reverse-trace closure | < 120 km | **0 km** |
| Reversed flux, pure dipole | exactly 0 | **0** |
| Two independent j_n implementations | < 1e-9 | **1.8e-16** |
| Layers able to host a dynamo | exactly 1 | **1** (outer core) |
| Tangent cylinder meets CMB at | closed form | **69.45°** |

### 3.2 Regression traps — each was a real bug, each fails silently

1. **Legendre stride.** Allocate at stride `NMAX+1`, never `nmax+1`. A truncated
   allocation gives silent NaN for every n < 13.
2. **Geodetic rotation sign.** `X_gd = X cos ψ + Z sin ψ`, `Z_gd = −X sin ψ + Z cos ψ`.
   A flipped sign is **exactly zero at the equator**, so an equator-only test
   passes a broken transform. Test off-equator.
3. **Coordinate tables.** Kyoto Table 1 carries both `G.M. LAT.` (centred
   dipole, what SYM-H uses) and `INVARIANT LAT.` Taking the wrong column cost
   9.35° at Hermanus and presented as a *model* error for a while. Both columns
   are kept side by side in `observatories.js` so the mistake is visible.
4. **Unlit data spheres.** Never Phong-shade a colormapped data texture — the
   lighting multiplies the values.
5. **αΩ timestep and conditioning** (new, found during this build). Two bugs:
   an analytic RK4 stability bound that was marginally too loose and produced a
   Nyquist grid mode masquerading as a growth rate of +69; and an
   ill-conditioned three-term recurrence that returned μ = 1 exactly (growth 0)
   for a genuinely decaying non-oscillatory mode. Fixed by measuring ρ(M)
   directly and guarding on the snapshot *correlation*.
6. **Miller recurrence start index** (new, and it was in BOTH copies). The
   spherical-Bessel routine must start its downward recurrence above **x** as
   well as above **n**. Starting from n alone is fine where the first zeros
   live (x ≲ n) so the decay times were never wrong — but it loses four digits
   for x ≫ n. `diffusion.js` deliberately carries its own independent copy of
   the routine so a shared bug cannot cancel on both sides of the
   solver-vs-analytic check, and that cross-check is exactly what exposed this:
   1.8×10⁻⁴ of disagreement at n=1, x=28. Both copies fixed; now 1.8×10⁻¹⁶.
7. **Reversed flux compared against the wrong thing** (new). A patch is
   reversed where B_r opposes the DIPOLE's own B_r at that point. The first
   version compared against the sign of the magnetic colatitude and got the
   sense inverted, reporting ~80% of the planet as reversed — wrong in a way
   that looks like a result. The gate now asserts a pure dipole field contains
   *exactly zero* reversed flux, which cannot pass with an inverted sign.
8. **A camera spring dressed up as a flight** (new). `render()` eased the
   camera toward the layer's framing distance on every frame with no
   termination and no interrupt, so the user's zoom was reverted about a
   second after every scroll — the view did not look broken in a screenshot,
   it looked broken in the hand. Two rules came out of it: a framing change is
   a one-shot tween that direct manipulation cancels, and anything that eases
   toward a goal needs a *termination condition*, because an exponential
   approach never arrives. `tests/tiga-smoke.spec.js` now zooms with a real
   wheel event and asserts the zoom is still there 2 s later, which is long
   past the point where the old spring had eaten it.
9. **Convergence near an eigenvalue collision**. A fixed settle budget
   left the quadrupole family unconverged near |D| ≈ 220 — where two of its
   real eigenvalues collide into a complex pair — returning +3.76 for a value
   near −0.5. That single bad sample inverted the family comparison and put a
   phantom window edge at |D| ≈ 185, ten times too narrow. `familyGrowth` now
   iterates to convergence and reports `converged`; the gate asserts the margin
   changes sign exactly twice.

## 4. Results (OSSE — simulated; no real observatory data yet)

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Index definition floor | **11.36 nT** — irreducible; the index's own aliasing |
| TIGA estimation error in q₁⁰ | **4.97 nT** — 2.3× below the floor |
| Dropout, 64 → 3.2 stations | 4.97 → 3.25 nT — **flat across a 20× reduction** |
| Calibration, nominal 68 / 95% | **41.9 / 69.2%** — open problem |
| vs memoryless control (zonal) | 4.97 vs 5.08 nT |

(The reference implementation reported 4.30 nT of estimation error against the
same 11.36 nT floor. The floor is deterministic and reproduces exactly; the
estimation error depends on the synthetic network draw and the observation
noise, and this port uses its own PRNG, so it lands nearby rather than
identically. Structural claims are what the gates pin.)

### 4.1 Prediction scorecard — the falsifications stay in the record

| # | Prediction | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Excluding the canonical eleven ≫ hurts | **FALSIFIED** — gap +0.07 nT. Three parameters are already over-determined by 64 stations. |
| 3 | Flat, then steep, knee at the parameter count | **CONFIRMED** — knee at 3. |
| 4a | Sector loss worse than random loss | **CONFIRMED** — 21.5 vs 19.0 ± 0.5 nT |
| 4b | The sector penalty decays with time since loss | **FALSIFIED** — a memoryless control decays identically. The decay is the storm, not the memory. |
| 5 | Station-set-dependent bias | **CONFIRMED** — bias, not variance, is the dropout signature |

Three confirmed, two falsified. The falsifications are the useful half: each was
caught by a control or by a frozen protocol, and **none would have been visible
on real data**, where there is no truth to check against.

### 4.2 An unplanned result: station count is the wrong variable

Losing **23** clustered Europe/Africa stations *improved* the order-1 estimate;
losing **9** well-placed American stations made it much worse. The mechanism is
conditioning and it is measurable. **Longitudinal spread is the right variable**
(`longitudeClustering` in `observatories.js`, `coverageDiagnostics` in
`ingest.js`), and it gives operators an actionable criterion. For a USGS-only
network it is the binding constraint — fourteen stations, a ~14 h MLT gap.

---

## 5. Open problems — do not paper over these

- **The posterior is not calibrated.** 68% nominal covers ~42%. A rank-1
  common-mode term in R fixed most of a 25× overconfidence (2.7% → ~45%); the
  rest is open. `tests/geomag-osse.mjs` gates the shortfall *deliberately*, so
  that a change which "improves" it by widening the bars fails the gate rather
  than passing quietly.
- **The live baseline is a placeholder.** `removeBaseline` subtracts a trailing
  median. The real thing is a causal trailing-window secular-variation and S_q
  baseline per USGS OFR 2011-1030, strictly one-sided. Until that exists the
  live nowcast's *shape* is meaningful and its absolute *level* is not, and the
  page carries a PROVISIONAL badge saying exactly that.
- **TIGA loses to a memoryless filter on the order-1 terms** (−11.7% in the
  reference runs) while winning on the zonal (+8.6%). Four retunes failed to fix
  it. It is a real trade-off, not a bug: the optimal process noise scales with
  storm amplitude, so a value tuned on one storm does not transfer. That is a
  defect in the *selection design*, and the fix is a causal activity proxy
  trained on a multi-storm set — not a new constant. **It bounds the ASY-H
  ambition.** Do not retune `DEFAULT_Q_RATE` without reading its comment.
- **The OSSE draws station latitude and longitude independently**, losing the
  real island/continent correlation. The eleven canonical stations are real
  coordinates; the synthetic tail is not.

## 6. Milestones

- **M0 — Foundation.** ✅ Kernels ported, gates green, page shipped.
- **M1 — Reference floors.** Compute RMS(SMR − SYM-H) and quicklook-vs-final
  Dst over ≥ 5 years. *Neither exists in the literature.* Without them a
  reported RMSE has no denominator. **Blocked on network access** to SuperMAG
  (needs a logon) and on Kyoto permission for quicklook comparisons.
- **M2 — Causal S_q baseline.** Trailing-window SV and S_q, strictly causal,
  tested in isolation against a non-causal oracle. *Accept: the causal penalty
  is quantified in nT.* Predicted to dominate the real-data error budget —
  measure it before building on it.
- **M3 — Held-out-station evaluation. THE DECISION POINT.** Fit on N−1
  observatories, predict the Nth station's actual reading. *Accept: RMSE for
  leave-one-out, leave-out-Pacific, leave-out-institute.* If the forward model
  cannot predict an unseen observatory, stop — no index-level tuning will save it.
- **M4 — Live scorecard.** 30 days continuous uptime, calibrated uncertainty
  published alongside every value, rolling comparison against Kyoto as
  provisionals appear.

## 7. Licensing — a commercial blocker, not a technical one

The chain is: **their data (free) → our estimator → an estimate with honest
uncertainty (the product).** The data passes through; it is never resold. We are
a step in the pipeline, not a reseller.

The legal ambiguity lives in **whose machine the data lands on**:

| Shape | Status |
|---|---|
| Data through our servers → free public index | Fine, NC-compatible |
| Data through our servers → paid output | **Grey zone** — "commercial use" is undefined |
| Our software on their infrastructure, their access | **Clean** — the data never touches us. This is the enterprise shape and the least friction |

- **INTERMAGNET is CC BY-NC 4.0.** A free research index is fine; a paid API
  serving a derived index is not, without written permission from each operating
  institute — roughly fifty of them.
- **SuperMAG prohibits redistribution.**
- **Kyoto requires permission** before publishing quicklook comparisons.
- **USGS is the clean path**: fourteen observatories, effectively public domain,
  among the fastest feeds in the network. `api/geomag/observatories.js` uses
  USGS only, and that is a deliberate decision, not a stopgap. A USGS-only fit
  is a *harder* problem with worse longitude coverage — **which makes the
  dropout result more impressive, not less.**

Resolve the tier question before any paid surface ships.

---

## 8. Non-goals

- 3-D MHD geodynamo simulation.
- Claiming to predict reversals. Rikitake shows reversals need no trigger; that
  is a statement about dynamos, not a forecast.
- Forecasting SYM-H. TIGA is a nowcast with zero lead time.
- Beating the t+1h forecasting literature. Different axis; the comparison is
  meaningless in either direction.

## 9. Practices this work earned the hard way

1. **Verify reference data, not just code.** The worst bug in the programme was
   a correct transform fed a wrong column. Isolate the transform with analytic
   anchors; isolate the data with an independent source. `tests/geomag-tiga.mjs`
   runs T1b (transform) before T1 (data) for exactly this reason.
2. **Every comparison needs a control.** "The penalty decays with time" looked
   true until a memoryless filter decayed identically. Build the null first.
3. **Freeze the protocol before looking.** Refitting the calibration per dropout
   level made degradation look like improvement.
4. **Separate estimation error from definition error.** Scoring against an index
   that carries its own aliasing measures the index.
5. **Render it and look at it.** Three chart bugs survived correct code in the
   research programme, and two more were caught by screenshotting this page.
6. **Record falsified predictions.** They were the most informative results here.
