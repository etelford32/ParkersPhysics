/**
 * site-sections.js — single source of truth for the site's TOP-LEVEL structure
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Five content sections, each with a hub page. Consumed by:
 *
 *   - js/nav.js                    the top-level dropdowns (id, label, hub
 *                                  href and the section headers inside each
 *                                  menu all come from here; nav.js owns only
 *                                  the CURATED item list per menu)
 *   - js/simulations-catalog.js    SIM_CATEGORIES is DERIVED from this list,
 *                                  so the catalog page's sections and the
 *                                  nav's top level cannot drift apart
 *   - scripts/build-section-pages.mjs
 *                                  bakes one static hub page per section
 *   - tests/site-sections.mjs      structural gate
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ───────────────
 * The nav grew to nine top-level items (Home · Simulations · Earth · Space
 * Weather · Hindcast Lab · Field Notes · Stars · Black Holes · Simulators) and
 * two failures followed from that, both measured on 2026-08-25:
 *
 *  1. HORIZONTAL. The bar fit every desktop width by 10–16px. That is not a
 *     margin, it is a coincidence — `.nav-menu` is `flex-wrap: nowrap` with
 *     `flex-shrink: 0` on everything except `.nav-utility-links`, over a `nav`
 *     that is `overflow: visible` on a body that does not scroll sideways, so
 *     the first item that does not fit becomes UNREACHABLE rather than
 *     clipped. One more menu, or a slightly wider system font, spent it.
 *
 *  2. VERTICAL — and this one was already live. "Space Weather" had grown to
 *     18 links across 3 sections: a 1110px panel hanging off a 50px bar. On
 *     every common laptop the bottom of it was simply off the screen, with
 *     nothing to scroll:
 *
 *          1366×768   7 links unreachable  (Jupiter … Galaxy)
 *          1536×864   5 links unreachable
 *          1440×900   4 links unreachable
 *          1920×1080  2 links unreachable
 *
 *     Exactly the same failure as the `max-height: 600px` mobile accordion
 *     bug documented in js/nav-styles.css, on the other axis, and for the same
 *     reason: a menu was allowed to grow without anything measuring it.
 *
 * The root cause behind both was an information architecture that had stopped
 * describing the product. "Space Weather" held Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
 * Neptune, the mission roster and the Milky Way map; "Simulators" was a
 * leftovers bin on a site where every page is a simulator; "Stars" and "Black
 * Holes" each spent a top-level slot on four to six links.
 *
 * So the top level is now FIVE physical domains plus the full catalog, each
 * one a real destination:
 *
 *      Space Weather   the Sun to the magnetosphere — the forecasting product
 *      Earth & Orbit   the near-Earth environment and the craft flying in it
 *      Local Space     the solar system and our galactic neighbourhood
 *      Deep Space      individual stars and strong-field spacetime
 *      Research        validation, methods, and the writing
 *      Simulations     the complete index (js/simulations-catalog.js)
 *
 * INVARIANT — MENUS MUST FIT THE SCREEN
 * ─────────────────────────────────────
 * A nav menu is capped at ~10 links and ~3 section headers, which lands under
 * 700px and therefore fits the 768px-tall laptop that is the floor. That cap
 * is what the hub pages are FOR: the menu is the curated way in, the hub is
 * the complete one. `tests/nav-responsive.spec.js` measures the rendered panel
 * against the viewport at 768/864/900/1080 and fails on a single link that
 * falls below the fold, so this cannot rot again by accident.
 *
 * ADDING A SECTION
 * ────────────────
 *   1. Append an entry below.
 *   2. Add its curated item list to NAV_ITEMS in js/nav.js.
 *   3. Run `node scripts/build-section-pages.mjs` to bake its hub page.
 *   4. Register the hub page in NON_SIMULATION_PAGES.
 *   5. Run `node tests/site-sections.mjs tests/simulations-catalog.mjs`
 *      and `node scripts/lint-nav.mjs`.
 * Re-measure the bar afterwards: at 1281px the widest state (admin, system
 * font) had +16px of headroom with seven dropdowns, and a sixth top-level
 * item is what spends it.
 *
 * Field reference
 *   id        kebab-case key. Also the SIM_CATEGORIES id, so every simulation
 *             filed under this section carries `category: <id>`.
 *   label     the nav's top-level button text. Short — it is bar width.
 *   href      the section's hub page, root-relative.
 *   icon      glyph id from js/glyphs.js (GLYPH_IDS).
 *   tagline   hub hero eyebrow, above the headline.
 *   headline  hub hero <h1>. Says what the domain IS, not what we sell.
 *   intro     hub hero paragraph, one or two sentences.
 *   note      one line, used as the section's blurb on simulations.html.
 *   groups    sub-groups WITHIN the section. These are the section headers in
 *             the nav menu and the sub-headings on the hub page. Every
 *             simulation in this section must name one of these group ids.
 *   extras    OPTIONAL. Sub-groups whose entries are declared inline instead
 *             of coming from the catalog, for pages that belong on a hub but
 *             are not simulations — the Field Notes essays under Research are
 *             the case this exists for. Same shape as `groups`, plus a `links`
 *             array of { href, title, blurb, icon, badge? }. They render as
 *             ordinary cards after the catalog groups. Do NOT use this to
 *             smuggle a simulation onto a hub without cataloguing it: the
 *             catalog's drift gate cannot see these, so tests/site-sections.mjs
 *             requires every extra href to be in NON_SIMULATION_PAGES.
