/**
 * bootes-void-data.js — the measured inputs, and only the measured inputs
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PURE data + coordinate conversion. No DOM, no fetch, no three.js.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE PROVENANCE BOUNDARY. Everything in here is either a
 * published measurement with a citation, or a conversion of one. Everything
 * downstream — the continuous density field, the filament network, the tracer
 * galaxies — is MODEL, and js/bootes-web-model.js says so in its own header.
 * If a number on bootes-void.html is presented as observed, it has to come
 * from this file or from a route; there is no third source.
 *
 * WHY THE COORDINATES ARE TYPED IN AND NOT FETCHED
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Astronomy archives (VizieR, SDSS SkyServer, NED) are egress-blocked in this
 * repo's build environment, exactly as NASA is for sun.html's SDO fixtures.
 * So the anchors below are transcribed from the literature at the precision
 * the literature quotes, each carrying its own `source` string, and
 * `scripts/fetch-bootes-anchors.mjs` refreshes them from VizieR on a machine
 * that has the network — the same pattern as scripts/fetch-sdo-fixtures.mjs.
 *
 * Transcribed coordinates are good to about ±0.2° and ±0.002 in redshift.
 * That is FINE for what they are used for (seeding where the biggest nodes of
 * the surrounding web sit, tens of Mpc apart) and NOT fine for anything that
 * needs an identification — do not use these to cross-match a catalogue.
 * `ANCHOR_ACCURACY` carries that statement in machine-readable form so the
 * page can print it rather than the reader having to trust a comment.
 *
 * THE h⁻¹ TRAP — the reason there is a conversion function and not a constant
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The void literature quotes sizes in h⁻¹ Mpc; the popular literature quotes
 * the same numbers in Mpc and light-years having quietly set h = 1. Those
 * differ by a factor of 1/0.677 = 1.48, which is the difference between a
 * 62 Mpc void and a 92 Mpc one. The discovery paper's own headline — "a
 * million cubic megaparsec void" — is a VOLUME in h⁻³ Mpc³, and taking its
 * cube root without the h is exactly how the 1.48 gets lost. So the radius is
 * stored ONCE, in h⁻¹ Mpc, and `effectiveRadiusMpc()` is the only place it
 * becomes a physical length.

     *     not an independent number.
     *   • The count is of galaxies above a survey limit, so it is a count of
     *     BRIGHT galaxies, which are the most strongly biased tracers there
     *     are, and void interiors are precisely where that bias is largest.
     *   • The profile's Δ(<R_eff) is a volume average over a fitted smooth
     *     field, which by construction includes the void's inner wall.
     *
     * The honest statement is that the void is nearly empty of BRIGHT GALAXIES
     * over its core and is about 20 % underdense in MATTER averaged inside
     * R_eff. Both are true. Only the second one drives gravity.

 *
 * WHAT THESE ARE FOR — and it is not what you would guess. They do NOT supply
 * masses to the gravity calculation. The surrounding web's mass budget is the
 * void profile's OWN compensating wall (see `wallMassMsun` in the model), so
 * that the clumped model and the smooth model agree at large radius and the
 * only thing being tested is CLUMPING. These anchors set WHERE that mass
 * concentrates: the web model biases its node placement towards the directions
 * these structures actually occupy, so the filament network around the void is
 * oriented like the real one instead of being isotropic noise.
 *
 * That distinction matters for Test 5. If the masses were invented, "does the
 * filament or the void dominate the local force?" would be a question about
 * the numbers somebody typed here. As built, it is a question about geometry.
 *
 * `massHintMsun` is an order-of-magnitude M₂₀₀ used only for RELATIVE
 * weighting between anchors. It is explicitly not a measurement and the page
 * never prints it as one.
 *
 * `shortName` is what the 3D stage prints beside each cluster. It is separate
 * from `name` because a label reading "Coma Cluster (Abell 1656)" is wider than
 * the object it points at and, at nine of them, the render becomes a wall of
 * text with a starburst somewhere behind it. The full name stays for prose and
