 * than reality. Below ~50 km of orbit range the patch's vertical scale ramps
 * down, reaching TRUE 1× by 14 km — sightseeing keeps its drama, short final
 * gets honest slopes, and the pilot cluster + HUD disclose the live
 * multiplier the whole way down.
 *
 * The ramp is driven by ORBIT RANGE (camera→target), NOT by altitude above
 * terrain: changing the scale moves the drawn ground, so an AGL-driven
 * controller would feed back through the very surface it displaces and
 * oscillate. Range is exaggeration-independent. The scale is quantized to
 * steps and the patch rebuilds only on a step change (a rebuild costs
 * ~40 ms — continuous rescale would jank the whole zoom).
 *
 * Decorative roughness compresses with the ramp (see rebuildRegionalTerrain):

 * 18× was tuned at Jezero, whose 520 km patch spans 4.75 km of real MOLA
 * relief (85 km drawn). Applied everywhere it was absurd where Mars is NOT
 * flat: Olympus Mons' patch spans 23.5 km, so it was drawn 422 km tall — the
 * camera, placed 9 km above the ground, pitched 20° down to find its target,
 * the ENTIRE frame fell below the local horizon, and the view was a wall of
 * facets against black void (measured). Valles Marineris (11.1 km) and Elysium
 * Mons (14.9 km) were nearly as bad.
 *
 * So the survey scale is capped per patch by a DRAWN-relief budget: the largest
 * step whose drawn span fits in REGIONAL_DRAWN_RELIEF_BUDGET_KM. 90 km keeps
 * Jezero at the documented 18× (and the flat plains — Hellas floor 1.9 km,
 * Utopia 1.6 km — too); Olympus draws at 3×, Valles at 8×, Elysium at 5×,
 * Gale and Argyre at 12×. The ramp below then runs from that ceiling down to
 * true scale exactly as before, and every HUD readout already prints the live
 * multiplier, so nothing claims a scale it is not drawing.
 *
 * The ceiling is a property of the MOLA data at the patch centre, never of the
 * camera, so it cannot feed back through the surface it scales (the AGL trap
 * the ramp note below describes).

 * ═══ WHY `controls` IS A `let` AND GETS REBUILT ═══════════════════════════
 *
 * OrbitControls captures its orbit axis ONCE, at construction:
 *
 *     js/vendor/three-0.160.0/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js:176
 *     const quat = new Quaternion().setFromUnitVectors(object.up, ...)
 *
 * That line sits in the closure around `this.update`, so it runs when the
 * instance is built and never again. **Assigning `camera.up` afterwards does
 * nothing to how the camera orbits.**
 *
 * The surface explorer sets `camera.up` to the local radial and then reasons
 * entirely in a local-horizon frame — polar limits, ground clearance, "don't
 * look below the horizon". None of that was reaching OrbitControls, which kept
 * orbiting about world +Y (Mars' spin axis). At Jezero, 18.4°N, the two frames
 * are ~72° apart, so every polar limit was applied to the wrong axis: dragging
 * "up" hit an invisible wall, dragging down swung the camera under the terrain,
 * and the placement code and the controls disagreed about where the camera even
 * was. It looked like several unrelated bugs; it is this one.
 *
 * The library exposes no way to re-seat that quaternion, so the frame is
 * refreshed by rebuilding the instance — cheap, and only when the local
 * vertical has actually moved (mode change, or enough travel across the
 * terrain to matter). Everything reads `controls` through this binding, and
 * `__marsLab` exposes it via a getter so external references never go stale.

 * a brown smear, flying to Olympus Mons at Jezero's noon showed nothing, and
 * the surface explorer landed on a featureless orange plane past the
 * terminator. Worse, the opening camera faces Jezero, so whether a first visit
 * saw a planet or a dark disc depended on the Mars hour it happened to arrive.
 *
 * So there are two lamps, and the page says which one is on:
 *   'map'  — a cartographic lamp that follows the VIEW: over the camera's upper
 *            left on the globe; low (35°) and from the viewer's left on the
 *            ground, which is the angle that reads relief. Every region is
 *            legible at every hour. The live day/night boundary is still drawn
 *            — the terminator LINE is the live layer in this mode.
 *   'live' — the real Sun from JPL Horizons / Mars24, exactly as before.
 *
 * `sunDirectionWorld` is ALWAYS the physical Sun, in every mode: the pilot
 * cluster's SUN readout, sunState(), the terminator, and the night-side
 * analysis-lamp decision read it. `sun.position` is the LAMP — the direction
 * the renderer, the sky dome, and the regolith shader's lit-relief term use —

 * ═══ CLOSE-RANGE DETAIL CASCADE ════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Below ~10 km the patch used to be a featureless wash: the Viking map is
 * ~15 km/px, the synth classes 11 km/cell, the decorative roughness 10–100 km
 * wavelengths — every visual channel a pilot uses on short final (ground
 * rush, texture-gradient height cues) was empty. This injects a procedural
 * regolith cascade into the patch material: three noise bands (~2.4 km,
 * ~450 m, ~90 m) that each FADE IN as the view distance drops, so survey
 * height keeps the photometric look and detail materializes on descent.
 *
 * The honesty rules:
 *   - albedo/shading ONLY — no geometry, so it cannot lie about shape at
 *     true scale, and the MOLA readouts never see it;
 *   - pattern frequency/amplitude ride the per-vertex synth class grain
 *     (dunes ripple, plains stay calm) — labelled synthesized in the HUD
 *     alongside the classes that drive it;
 *   - noise coordinates are the REFERENCE-SPHERE direction × radius —
 *     radius-independent, so the pattern is pixel-stable across relief-ramp
 *     steps, patch rebuilds, and recenters (world-position input would
 *     reseed the texture on every ramp step — the surface moves radially).
 * The mid band adds a sun-relative two-tap "lit relief" term (bright on the
 * sun side of each bump, dark on the lee) — cheap depth without touching
 * the normal pipeline. uDetailStrength comes from the quality ladder; 0
 * branches the whole cascade out for software rasterisers.

/**
 * ═══ REAL-IMAGERY INSET ════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Every surface on this page sampled ONE 1440×720 global texture — 4 px/°,
 * ~15 km/px. That is why the 520 km regional patch (~37 texels wide) rendered
 * as a smooth wash and why js/terrain-wfc.js had to synthesize over the gap:
 * below 15 km there was no data to draw.
 *
 * This blends a streamed NASA Trek mosaic over the base map wherever the
 * camera is actually looking — 232 m/px Viking, 100 m/px THEMIS, ~5 m/px CTX.
 * The synth layer keeps its job of covering what no instrument resolved; it
 * just has far less to cover now.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND SAMPLER AND NOT A TILED MESH. The globe and the regional patch
 * both already carry GLOBAL EQUIRECT UVs (see latLonUv), so one uniform rect in
 * that same UV space addresses both meshes identically. Rebuilding the page
 * around quadtree patch meshes would be an enormous change for the same pixels.
 * `js/earth-detail-inset.js` made the same call for the same reason.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - `vTileUv` is declared from the `uv` attribute directly, NOT reused from
 *    three's `vMapUv`. vMapUv only exists under `#ifdef USE_MAP`, and
 *    `surfaceTexture` is null whenever the bundled JPEG fails to load — the
 *    shader would then fail to COMPILE and take the whole globe with it, on
 *    exactly the degraded path that most needs to keep rendering.
 *  - The inset texture is tagged SRGBColorSpace, so WebGL decodes it in
 *    hardware and `texture2D` returns LINEAR values — matching `diffuseColor`
 *    after `<map_fragment>`. Blending raw sRGB into linear would wash the
 *    inset out by roughly a gamma.
 *  - The alpha channel carries COVERAGE. Tiles that failed to load are left
 *    transparent by the stitcher, so the base texture shows through a hole
 *    rather than a fabricated colour.

 * Hypsometric tint from the REAL MOLA elevation.

 * This replaces a tint driven by the decorative roughness above, which meant
 * the only colour variation on the patch encoded invented data. Now the shading
 * a viewer reads as "that ridge is higher" actually is higher.
 *
 * The ramp normalizes to the PATCH's own relief span rather than a fixed
 * altitude band. Mars ranges from Hellas at −8 km to Olympus at +21 km, so any
 * global constant is wrong nearly everywhere: it flattens Jezero's ~1 km of
 * local structure to nothing while clipping the Tharsis flanks to solid white.
 * Per-patch normalization means every region reads at the same contrast — and
 * matters more here than it would elsewhere, because the bundled MOLA raster is
 * 4 px/°, so a 520 km patch has only ~37 real samples per side to work with.
 *
 * `spanM` is floored so a genuinely flat patch (northern plains) does not have
 * its noise amplified into fake topography.

 * The palettes below are the real thing, not stylisation. Mars' daytime sky is
 * butterscotch because suspended dust absorbs blue; at low sun the SAME dust
 * forward-scatters, which is why Mars has warm days and famously BLUE sunsets —
 * the inverse of Earth. `uSunTint` carries that swing, so the glow around the
 * Sun goes cool as it sets. Do not "correct" it to an orange sunset.
 *
 * Draw order: star field (renderOrder −2) then the dome (−1), both after the
 * opaque terrain. The dome depth-tests against the terrain so the ground is
 * never painted over, and being drawn after the stars it hides them by day and
 * — at its low night alpha — lets them through after dark. Its radius sits
 * BEYOND the stars (0.6 > 0.5) so nothing about that ordering depends on luck.

/**
 * ═══ SAFE FRAME ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * The canvas is full-bleed and the panels float over it, so the optical centre
 * of the render (the canvas centre) sat BEHIND them: the "Global view" globe
 * was 770 px tall in an 850 px canvas with ~60% of it under the Perseverance
 * panel, the layers panel, the MEDA dock and the title, and a flown-to feature
 * landed in the middle of the screen, which on desktop is where the header is.
 *
 * So the unobstructed rectangle is measured from the live panel boxes and the
 * projection's principal point is moved into its centre with setViewOffset —
 * the renderer still draws the whole canvas (the planet shows through the
 * translucent panels exactly as before), but everything the camera LOOKS AT is
 * centred where it can be seen, and the global view is distanced so the whole
 * disc fits there. Picking is unaffected: Raycaster.setFromCamera reads the
 * offset projection, so NDC under the cursor still maps to the right ray.
 *
 * Rules for what counts as an obstruction are deliberately coarse: a side panel
 * narrows the frame only while it is TALL (a collapsed panel is a pill in a
 * corner, not a wall), and nothing obstructs on the stacked phone layout
 * (≤820 px, where the panels flow below the canvas) or with panels hidden.

 * 5 km from its target by then, so the page was holding back nearly 3× of real
 * resolution exactly where a pilot is reading the ground.

 * So the footprint SHRINKS with the camera, which is what makes zooming reveal
